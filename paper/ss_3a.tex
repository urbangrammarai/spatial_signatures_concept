\subsection{Definition}
\label{ssec:ss_def}

% keep it short, one or two paragraphs

%  start with the definition (pretty technical one)
characterisation of space based on form and function designed to understand urban environment
- geared towards understadning urban spaces
- SS - a distinct type of space based ...
- both granularity and scalability built-in

% a way of understanding space. not evena  unit
% information is the key component of it


% SS sit in between purely morphological and purely functional.



% urban tissue definition:  A distinct area of a settlement in all three dimensions,
% characterised by a unique combination of streets, blocks/plot series, plots,
% buildings, structures and materials and usually the result of a distinct process
% of formation at a particular time or period.



%%%%%%% copy&paste from brainstorming
% Introduction of the concept of Spatial Signature as a building block reflecting physical, functional and socio-economical structure of cities.

%% atomic urban building block

%% multidimensional cross-sectional geodemographic unit

%% linkage of geodemographic concepts

%% cross-disciplinarity

%% spatial signatures should have the ability to classify all types of settlements and distinguish their physical and socio-economical differences (e.g. informal settlement vs slum)

% Goal, why SS?

% organic aggregation

% it flips the land cover = urban is the main
