\subsection{Definition}
\label{ssec:ss_def}

%%%%%%% copy&paste from brainstorming
% Introduction of the concept of Spatial Signature as a building block reflecting physical, functional and socio-economical structure of cities.

%% atomic urban building block

%% multidimensional cross-sectional geodemographic unit

%% linkage of geodemographic concepts

%% cross-disciplinarity

%% spatial signatures should have the ability to classify all types of settlements and distinguish their physical and socio-economical differences (e.g. informal settlement vs slum)

%% why Spatial signature makes sense, how is it related to existing theories (e.g. city as a complex adaptive system)

% Goal, why SS?

% organic aggregation
