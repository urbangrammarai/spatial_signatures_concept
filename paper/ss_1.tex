% Importance of cities
% Importance of the spatial arrangement of cities
How we spatially arrange the building blocks that make up a city matters.
%
The map of many European cities tells the story of the different historical
periods in which they were born, grew and, in some cases, contracted.
%
American cities which ``came of age'' in the second half of the XXth Century
would look very different had the automobile not been the defining
technology of the time.
%
And the stark contrasts between luxury developments and informal settlements
that can be observed across many cities of the Global South are a reflection
of the wide range of disparities and inequalities that those societies
display.
%
This encoding is also sticky. Although cities are constantly in flux, new
innovations and waves of change rarely start from scratch. More commonly, they
are added in a layered way. Over time, each phase, each change blends with the rest
of the urban fabric to give a city its uniquely distinct pattern that defines
it almost as a strand of DNA.
% Two sides of arranging stuff: form and function
The building blocks include the different
elements of the built and natural environments of which cities are composed,
but also the purpose they serve.
Understanding the former thus requires us to consider urban \textit{form}, while
grasping the latter invites us to examine its \textit{function}.
% FF encode history, technology and the values of the society that shapes
% them
Urban form and function are relevant for two main reasons. First, their fabric
encodes the socio-economic history, technology and values
of the society that has built them.
%
Studying the nature and distribution
of form and function in cities thus helps us better understand the societies
that, over time, have shaped them.
% but, once in place, it also has important implications
The second reason why urban form and function are important is that they are
not only a history book recording the past, but also play an important role in
defining the present and shaping the future.
%
Once in place, their features and structure have direct implications for a
wide range of outcomes, from productivity and job access to social inclusion
and mobility, deprivation, service provision, energy consumption or carbon
emissions, to name just a few.


% Gaps
However, the study of urban form and function is deeply fragmented.
%% fragmentation (academia/policy, disciplines)
Work focusing on the form and function of cities is scattered across
different academic disciplines and policy-making scenes. This is not
necessarily a problem in itself since different backgrounds
provide a richer picture. And there is much to be gained from a plurality of
perspectives.
%
It does however mean that the evidence available presents different
interests as well as varying degrees of detail, consistency, and coverage.
% Academia
It is understandable that economists develop conceptualisations shaped around
economic theories, while geographers do so, paying attention to spatial scales,
and yet other disciplines bring different aspects to focus.
% Policy
Similarly, decision-makers interested in understanding aspects of urban form
and function tend to see it through the lenses provided by the vantage point
they occupy. Regional planners may try to obtain as much detail as
possible for a relatively small geographical area; while supra-national
organisations may prioritise scale and coverage at the expense of detail.

%% need for detailed, consistent and scalable: currently, pick two
There is a clear need for detailed, consistent, and scalable evidence on urban
form and function.
% Why
Detailed and granular measurement that can be performed across large
geographical extents in a comparable way can unlock insights that get lost
when we can only observe certain regions of the picture developed for a large
extent does not have sufficient detail.
%
This is because many of the
theoretical underpinnings of urban form and function that reflect its history
and influence present and future outcomes tend to operate at fine scales but,
to be able to observe meaningful differences, we need to consider many and
different places.
%
For example, the characters that define Medieval city centres in Europe
quickly blur when the geographical unit considered is coarse. But, to be able to
examine how these characters relate to different levels of walkability, or
even of gas emissions, we require a large extent to set up meaningful
comparisons.

% What we currently have
Of detail, consistency and scale, the current research landscape described above
provides, at best, any two.
%
There is an abundance of detailed studies that consistently measure form and
function, but these are in their majority confined to case studies with very
limited geographical extents.
%
On the other end of the scale spectrum, recent years have seen the appearance
of work at a global scale that is consistent. However, their degree of detail
tends to be hindered by data limitations.
%
Finally, one could understand the multitude of detailed case studies in
conjunction as a growing body of evidence that is able to reach a sizeable
scale. But, in these case, the fragmentation discussed earlier often
translates in a lack of consistency that prevents meaningful comparisons.

% Opportunities
These limitations are beginning to be overcome thanks to
recent advances on the data, technological and methodological fronts.
%% data
New forms of data such as open cadastres, consumer datasets derived from
modern business operations, or high resolution, public satellite imagery are
greatly improving the descriptions we can build of cities
\citep{arribas2014accidental}. Progressively, we are able to build denser and
more up to date representations of urban environments at a cheaper cost.
%% technology
Technological developments such as the dramatic increase of computational
power available to researchers, or improvements in computer algorithms and machine
learning are lowering the entry barrier to advances that only a few years ago
required a high degree of dedicated expertise to be able to benefit from.
%% methodologies (morphometrics, GDS)
Perhaps more importantly, recent methodological contributions such as
morphometrics \citep{dibble2016urban} or geographic data science
\citep{singleton2021geographic} are paving the way to blend these advances
with domain knowledge and urban theory, effectively enabling disciplines
concerned with the form and function of cities to benefit from such
developments.

% Preview
In this paper, we introduce the spatial signatures as a characterisation of
space based on form and function designed to understand urban environments.
%% What: form and function
The spatial signatures are thus a delineation that divides geographical space
based on its appearance (form) and how it is used (function).
It is not a classification of space as much as a way of thinking around
classifying space based on form and function. Hence, it is an ideal candidate
for deployment on a wide range of data landscapes and geographical regions, as
we illustrate in Section \ref{sec:app}.

% Relevance
The spatial signatures hold important potential both for urban academics and
policy-makers.
%% Academic
From an academic point of view, they are relevant as a goal in themselves
that allows us to better measure and study the spatial configuration of the
building blocks that make up cities. But they also represent a platform on
which other disciplines can build on to embed form and function on a variety
of socio-environmental outcomes.
%% Policy
For policy-makers, the spatial signatures provide a framework for detailed
spatial understanding of the cities and territories their decisions affect.
Because of the flexibility of the concept, they are useful both in the global
north, where cities are constantly recast and retrofitted, as well as the
global south, where most of the new urbanisation is currently taking place.
%
In summary, the spatial signatures allow us to move forward in realising
detailed, consistent, and scalable measurement of form and function in
cities.

% Remainder structure of the paper
The remaining of the paper is structured as follows. Section \ref{sec:lit}
reviews existing literature on urban form and function, highlighting current
gaps. Section \ref{sec:ss} details our proposal of spatial signatures,
including how we define conceptualise them, the spatial unit we develop to
measure them --the enclosed tessellation cell--, and the embedding of form and
function into such unit. In Section \ref{sec:app}, we illustrate the
flexibility of the spatial signatures by presenting an application to five
rather different global cities. And we conclude in Section
\ref{sec:conclusions} with some reflection about the value and potential of
our approach.
