\subsection{Existing gaps}
\label{sec:lit_gaps}
% Limits (gaps)
% - limits of existing methods
% -- where these methods can't deliver
% --- detail, comprehensiveness, scalability (each lacks at least one)
% --- data requirements (some are dependent on detailed data (Berghauser Pont, high-res RS))
% ---- this could conclude with limits of open RS data "forcing" us to work with morphometrics -> link to the last part
% ---- we need training data before we can go RS way - we need theory before
% - limits of function
% - limits of existing existing work combining two
% opportunities to cross-pollinate to each other / hard for field to talk to each other
% SpSig should be unifying (link back to this section from section 3)
However, all the methods above have certain limits, mostly related to detail,
comprehensiveness and scalability, lacking at least one of them. The situation is
similar in both classification from the perspective of form and function. Detail
reflects spatial granularity of resulting classification, where more granular, i.e. more
detailed, unit has the ability to capture smaller nuances of the urban environment and
better reflect local characters or a place. Methods based on a unit which can be further
subdivided \citep{dibble2019origin,jochem2020,araldi2019,gil2012}, therefore does not
ensure internal homogeneity, can result in classes driven by the heterogeneity instead
of the unit instead of the actual pattern of built environment. Comprehensiveness refers
to the number of characters (variables) used in the classification procedure. Small sets
of characters as in \cite{bobkova2019} or \cite{serra2018a} are prone to a selection
bias and will less likely reflect the complexity of the urban environment. Finally,
scalability reflects the ability of the proposed method to scale up to large extents of
metropolitan areas or national-level studies. While some works illustrate such a
potential \citep{jochem2020, schirmer2015,bobkova2019,araldi2019}, others which may
overcome other issues are less likely to scale from their original limits
\citep{dibble2019origin}. Furthermore, computational scalability can be limited by data
availability. Methods dependent on a high amount of detailed vector data
\citep{bobkova2019} or specific local demographic information (REF) can be hardly
applied in other contexts where such input is not available. 
% TODO: Add references to function lit. The text is general and covers both now.


% Union
%% The union between form and function
% - theory of the interconnectedness of the two
% - form <-> function

% - some papers combining both (from umm - Bourdic, Serra, partially Alexiou, some resilience work; add other)
% -- check Angel's papers
% -- productivity/econ, 
% -- efficiency
% -- environmental, fiscal (OECD) argument
% -- social integration and isolation
% -- accessibility

% -- papers coming from morphological background (mostly)
% Bourdic, Salat and Nowacki 2012 - Land use, mobility, water, biodiversity, equity, economy, waste, culture, energy
% Serra, Psarra and O'Brien 2018 - Income deprivation (IMD)
% Song and Knaap 2007; Song, Popkin and Larsen 2013 - Land use, accessibility, transport
% Torrens 2008 - occupier profile
% Zheng et al 2014 - population density, proximity
% Ewing 2002 (SGA) - population (county level)
% Venerandi 2019 - social housing, commerce & services, job accessibility, housing stock
% Alexiou 2016 - proximity, very little form

% OECD 2018 - top level focus on sprawl, mostly population

% The link between the two (f+f) seems to be very weak and not many people combine both
% into a single classification method. Furthermore, if they do, the one or the other is
% just very simplified (population only, density only). Alternatively, they combine them
% reasonably (Bourdic 2012), but the result lacks granularity (their work is on city
% scale, Ewing on county scale).

Whilst literature often focuses either on form or on function, the two can be studies
independently but and deeply interconnected. Form reflects and influences function and
vice versa (REF). Therefore, any classification of built environment which aims to
provide a comprehensive picture of the reality needs to work with both aspects at the
same time. 

% The link is not uncommon but one aspect sometimes dominates the other and/or is not
% one of the three (detailed, scalable, comprehensive) - NOTE - if we criticise existing
% research for not being balanced between form and function we shoot ourselves to the
% foot because our examples are not ideally balanced either (even GB is
% currently a bit skewed towards form).

One example of a comprehensive combination of form and function into a singular
classification is the work of \cite{bourdic2012}, proposing an inclusive system of
spatial indicators ranging from form to biodiversity, culture and energy on a scale of
individual cities. Common are links between form and land use (song 2007,2013,
bourdic2012), population (Zheng2014, Ewing 2002, OECD2018, ahlfeldt2019) and
accessibility (venerandi2019, alexiou2016). However, the body of research directly
working with both form and function in a single framework is not large and the limits
related to scalability, comprehensiveness and detail are even more eminent.
