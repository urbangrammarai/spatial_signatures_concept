  abstract = {Large-scale land cover classification from satellite imagery is still a challenge due to the big volume of data to be processed, to persistent cloud-cover in cloud-prone areas as well as seasonal artefacts that affect spatial homogeneity. Sentinel-2 times series from Copernicus Earth Observation program offer a great potential for fine scale land cover mapping thanks to high spatial and temporal resolutions, with a decametric resolution and five-day repeat time. However, the selection of best available scenes, their download together with the requirements in terms of storage and computing resources pose restrictions for large-scale land cover mapping. The dataset presented in this paper corresponds to global cloud-free pixel based composite created from the Sentinel-2 data archive (Level L1C) available in Google Earth Engine for the period January 2017- December 2018. The methodology used for generating the image composite is described and the metadata associated with the 10 m resolution dataset is presented. The data with a total volume of 15 TB is stored on the Big Data platform of the Joint Research Centre. It can be downloaded per UTM grid zone, loaded into GIS clients and displayed easily thanks to pre-computed overviews.}

  abstract = {Remote sensing techniques are now commonly applied to map and monitor urban land uses to measure growth and to assist with development and planning. Recent work in this area has highlighted the use of textures and other spatial features that can be measured in very high spatial resolution imagery. Far less attention has been given to using geospatial vector data (i.e. points, lines, polygons) to map land uses. This paper presents an approach to distinguish residential settlement types (regular vs. irregular) using an existing database of settlement points locating structures. Nine data features describing the density, distance, angles, and spacing of the settlement points are calculated at multiple spatial scales. These data are analysed alone and with five common remote sensing measures on elevation, slope, vegetation, and nighttime lights in a supervised machine learning approach to classify land use areas. The method was tested in seven provinces of Afghanistan (Balkh, Helmand, Herat, Kabul, Kandahar, Kunduz, Nangarhar). Overall accuracy ranged from 78% in Kandahar to 90% in Nangarhar. This research demonstrates the potential to accurately map land uses from even the simplest representation of structures.}
